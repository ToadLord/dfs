        About CNIB – The Canadian National Institute for the Blind
      </h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          <strong>Founded in 1918</strong>, CNIB (Canadian National Institute
          for the Blind) is a national non-profit organization that empowers
          people who are blind, partially sighted, or deafblind to live their
          lives without barriers.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Through programs focused on advocacy, accessible technology, skills
          development, and community connection, CNIB works to break down
          societal and systemic challenges faced by Canadians with vision loss.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 italic">
          Their mission is to change what it is to be blind today — creating an
          inclusive world where everyone can thrive, no matter their level of
          sight.

        Our Mission
      </h2>
      <p>
        Drive for Sight is a non-profit charity car show dedicated to raising
        awareness and support for Canadians living with vision loss. Through a
        community-driven event, we aim to bring together car enthusiasts, local
        businesses, and supporters to make a meaningful impact for the CNIB
        Foundation.

        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p>
        Drive for Sight was founded in 2025 by Larena Vijayakumar, an
        Ottawa-based car enthusiast with a personal connection to the cause.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Larena’s mother lost her right eye at the age of two and has lived with
        partial vision ever since. Growing up, Larena witnessed the everyday
        challenges of vision loss — not just the physical obstacles, but also
        the assumptions and stigma that often come with it. This experience
        shaped her understanding of how capable and resilient people living with
        blindness truly are.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Combining her passion for cars with a desire to give back, Larena
        created Drive for Sight to bring the automotive community together in
        support of vision health. The event is built on the belief that a car
        show can do more than showcase vehicles — it can support a cause, spark
        conversations, and make a meaningful impact.

        grow as the population ages. The CNIB Foundation provides tools,
        training, and community programs to help individuals live independent,
        full lives despite sight challenges.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">

        programs and raising public awareness about the realities and
